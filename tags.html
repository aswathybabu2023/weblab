<h3>
<p> Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994â€“1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls.He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo It took him 78 ODIs to score his first century.</p><p>Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field. After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.India went on to win that match.</p></h3>
